# Phase 3b-0 · Apple builds in CI (no Mac, no signing)

Goal: every Apple-specific line compiles and runs at least once in CI on GitHub's macOS runners, so iOS
and macOS work can continue without a Mac. No signing identity, no TestFlight, no store work. Design:
`docs/architecture.md` ("Apple builds (Phase 3b-0)"). Pins: `native/kiwix/corekiwix.lock.json`.

Runner: `macos-latest` (Apple silicon) = macOS 26.6.2, Xcode 26.6, iOS Simulator 26.5 (iPhone 17).

## Acceptance criteria

| Criterion | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `ios-simulator` and `desktop-macos` green on main; existing jobs unchanged and green | Green on main, cold and warm runs (see "CI runs and timings"); every existing job green on every run |
| Swift binding unit tests pass on the Simulator | **26/26** (`SkepiZim-Unit-Tests`, iPhone 17 / iOS 26.5): binding 10, catalog + hash 5, viewer sealing 11 |
| Maestro iOS flows pass or are skipped with a hardware reason | **7/7 pass** (6 app flows + the secure-storage failure flow); the skipped flows are listed below, each with its reason |
| Bundle scan for card step texts on iOS and macOS | iOS: the built `main.jsbundle` (Hermes), PASS 0/202, in the build phase and as a CI step. macOS: the Developer Preview UI that `tauri build` embeds, PASS 0/202 |
| Typecheck, lint, unit tests, Rust gates green locally (Windows) and in CI | Local: `pnpm verify` 46/46 tasks (JS unit tests 544, 8 of them new), `cargo fmt` / `clippy -D warnings` / `cargo test` (42 passed, 1 ignored: needs the GGUF). CI: the same on Linux, Windows and macOS |
| No network at runtime except user-initiated downloads | iOS: no code path to the network in this phase (downloads and P2P report "not supported"). macOS: idle egress run, **0 connections outside loopback** (app + WebKit Networking + WebContent; `lsof` 160 samples; `nettop` 0 external bytes) |
| Every file verified against the signed catalog before opening | The core path is unchanged (`@skepi/core` verifies before `openArchive`). Maestro: provisioned packs count as "installed" only after the startup hash against the embedded release catalog. Swift tests: the committed catalogs' Ed25519 signatures (the 9 cases of `catalog/verification-expectations.json`) and the fixtures' whole-file and chunk hashes |
| No secrets in CI; nothing signed | No secret is used. The checked Release build is `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`; the macOS bundle is `--no-sign`. Owner decision (2026-10-11): the Simulator copy that Maestro installs is ad-hoc signed with no identity (see "Simulator signing") |

## What compiles

| Area | iOS (Simulator, Release, unsigned) | macOS desktop (aarch64, release, unsigned) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| libzim 9.7.0 | `SkepiZim` pod: Objective-C++ shim (`SKZArchive`) over the iOS slices of CoreKiwix.xcframework 14.2.1-2 | `crates/zim-ffi`: the existing cxx shim over the macOS slice of the same xcframework, thinned with `lipo` and linked statically |
| Article viewer | `SealedWebView` (WKWebView): `zim://` scheme handler, content rule list, page JavaScript off, no script message handlers or user scripts, non-persistent data, no fraud lookups or link previews, CSP header + meta on every response, blackout CSS | Tauri viewer window over the `zim` protocol (`zim://localhost` on WKWebView), JavaScript off, incognito, no IPC capability |
| Inference | llama.rn built from source (`RNLLAMA_BUILD_FROM_SOURCE=1`) | llama.cpp with Metal (`metal` feature) |
| Other native code | `expo-hash` (SkepiHash, CryptoKit), `expo-content-store` (local files, embedded catalog, import), `expo-device-profile`, `expo-emergency-tools`, `expo-transfer` (unsupported) | Keychain app.db key, sysctl/statvfs probes, `getifaddrs` Station addresses, `maps://localhost` / `zim://localhost` origins |
| Third-party native | React Native 0.86 / Expo 57 (prebuilt React Native core, as in Expo's template), MapLibre (Swift package), op-sqlite with SQLCipher | Tauri 2.12, rusqlite with vendored SQLCipher/OpenSSL, rustls |

## What runs in CI

**iOS (`ios-build` + `ios-e2e`; one `ios-simulator` job until the follow-up below).** `ios-build` runs steps 1–5; `ios-e2e` runs step 6 on the Simulator apps that `ios-build` built.

1. `expo prebuild -p ios --clean --no-install`, `pod install` (SkepiZim with its test spec, SkepiHash, llama.rn from source).
2. Draft-cards gate: `plugins/ios/skepi-xcode.sh resources` with `CONFIGURATION=Release` and no preview flag **fails** with "emergency cards are DRAFT" (like `skepiCheckEmergencyCards` on Android).
3. `xcodebuild` Release, `iphonesimulator`, `ARCHS=arm64`, `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`, `SKEPI_PREVIEW=1`. Build phases embed the release catalog (verified with the release keys) and the map assets, check the cards with `--preview` and scan the built bundle.
4. The app binary holds no `curl_*` / `MHD_*` symbol (CoreKiwix's unused downloader and server are not linked); libzim symbols are present.
5. XCTest `SkepiZim-Unit-Tests` on a Simulator: 26/26 (table below).
6. Maestro 2.11.0 (zip pinned by SHA-256) on a fresh Simulator. First the unsigned build must stop on "Secure storage unavailable" (`e2e/ios/startup/secure-storage-unavailable.yaml`). Then the ad-hoc copy, with the packs provisioned (`wikipedia_en_top_mini`, `wikipedia_en_medicine_mini`, `map-gr`, `places-gr`; URLs and SHA-256 from the embedded release catalog), runs `01-onboarding` … `06-cards-preview`, then the retrieval parity run (`e2e/ios/parity.yaml`, see "Follow-up").

| Swift test class | Tests | What |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ZimArchiveTests` | 10 | open + metadata; same file → same archive; full-text + suggestions (`canberra`); cross-archive order; read HTML and a missing entry; plain-text sections (References dropped); the Android text rules on a synthetic page; only files in app storage open (`..`, missing, non-ZIM, fake ZIM); content root excluded from backup; concurrent searches |
| `CatalogHashTests` | 5 | the 9 committed catalog cases (ok, unknown_key, bad_signature, rollback, sequence_reuse); a flipped byte breaks the signature; fixture ZIMs equal their signed entries (whole file + 64 KiB chunks, progress); cancel; empty file |
| `SealingTests` | 11 | JS off; script handlers and user scripts refused and logged; the inline script does not run in the real page; **content blocker: a loopback listener sees the control web view connect and the sealed configuration never** (img, CSS, iframe, video over http and https); non-zim navigations reported; load entry points refuse non-zim (HTTP, file, data, POST); CSP on every response (200/404/403); blackout CSS after the CSP; path traversal (16 forms); non-persistent data, no fraud lookups, no link previews |

| Maestro flow (iOS Simulator) | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `startup/secure-storage-unavailable` (unsigned build) | Pass: "Secure storage unavailable", `Error code: ERR_SECURE_STORAGE_READ (ERR_KEY_CHAIN)`, Retry shows it again |
| `01-onboarding` | Pass: English, Greece, tier, both Wikipedia packs "installed" after the startup hash, disclaimer, home |
| `02-search-article` | Pass: suggestions, full-text, the first result in the sealed viewer, "Blocked requests: 0" |
| `03-ask-layer1` | Pass: Layer 1 excerpts with the "not verified advice" label, no AI summary (no model), an unrelated question has no source |
| `04-emergency-first` | Pass: CPR shows "Emergency? Call 112" and the card first ("Under professional review"); earthquake shows the number above Layer 1; no AI summary on emergency intent |
| `05-map` | Pass: "Map ready" from the verified `map-gr` PMTiles (style assets from the bundle via `asset://`) |
| `06-cards-preview` | Pass: 112, the card under review, no steps, no read-aloud |

**macOS (`desktop-macos`).** `cargo fmt --check`; `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --no-default-features --features desktop-core/metal,skepi-desktop/metal -D warnings`; `cargo test` (desktop-core 30 incl. the Keychain key and the sysctl/statvfs probes, catalog fixtures 1, Station over TLS 6, zim-ffi on the fixtures 5; inference 1 ignored: needs the GGUF); the Developer Preview UI scan; `tauri build --target aarch64-apple-darwin --bundles app,dmg --no-sign` (`SKEPI.app` and `SKEPI_0.1.0-preview_aarch64.dmg`, kept 7 days as a workflow artifact); `otool -L` lists only `/usr/lib` and `/System` libraries and no curl/microhttpd symbol is linked; the idle egress run (90 s): the app stays up, creates app.db with its key in the Keychain, and makes no connection outside loopback.

**Existing jobs and local checks.** Every existing job (verify, rag-eval-smoke, android-release-guards, desktop-windows) stayed green on every run. Locally: release APK (preview, release key) with `PREVIEW CARDS PASS 0/202`; Maestro on the Galaxy S23 (release, airplane mode) `onboarding`, `ask-en`, `cards`: **3/3**, blocked WebView requests 0, ContentStore requests 0, 0 bytes over real interfaces (the app.db key change also runs on Android); desktop Playwright 15/15.

## Found and fixed on the way

- **Blank screen when the secure storage fails (real bug, both phones).** The first Simulator run hung on a white screen: the unsigned build has no entitlements, the Keychain refused (errSecMissingEntitlement, -34018), `appDb()` rejected, the rejected promise stayed cached and the root layout waited forever. Now `@skepi/db` `loadOrCreateDatabaseKey` reads the key, or writes a new one and reads it back; any failure is a `SecureStorageError` (`ERR_SECURE_STORAGE_READ` / `_WRITE` with the native code, e.g. `ERR_KEY_CHAIN`, and the OSStatus when the message has one); a failed read never creates a new key; there is no fallback key store and no unencrypted database. The app shows "Secure storage unavailable", the code, the native message and Retry, and logs the code (never the key); a failed open is not cached. 8 unit tests with the error shapes of expo-secure-store on iOS (KeyChainException) and Android (Keystore and encrypt failures); the unsigned Simulator build is the end-to-end check.
- Metal on macOS: ggml-metal's `@available` checks need `__isPlatformVersionAtLeast` from clang's runtime, which the release link with `--target` did not pull in; the app's build script links `libclang_rt.osx.a` (only the members it needs).
- ccache was not used on iOS (Xcode 26 explicit modules bypass React Native's CC wrapper): Xcode's `C_COMPILER_LAUNCHER` now runs it. The first macOS Rust cache was saved by a run that stopped at clippy and a full key hit is never re-saved: new key.
- Test fixes: one loopback probe per web view in the content-blocker test (the control view kept connecting after a reset); the document title awaited after `didFinish`.

## Simulator signing (owner decision, 2026-10-11)

The Simulator's Keychain refuses an app with no entitlements, so an unsigned build cannot keep the app.db key.
The copy that Maestro installs is rebuilt with "Sign to Run Locally" (`CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY=-`, `CODE_SIGN_STYLE=Manual`,
empty `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` and profile) and `e2e/ios/simulator-ci.entitlements` (`application-identifier`,
`keychain-access-groups`). No team, certificate, provisioning profile or secret; `codesign -dv` shows
`Signature=adhoc`, `TeamIdentifier=not set` (CI fails on a team identity); such a build runs only in the Simulator
and cannot be installed on a device. The checked Release build stays `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO` and runs the failure flow.

## Skipped, and why

| Flow / check | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| Tools: SOS torch, compass, location fix, SMS hand-off | Hardware: the Simulator has no torch, compass or GNSS receiver |
| P2P share / receive, Station → iPhone | iOS has no LocalOnlyHotspot; `expo-transfer` reports "not supported on this platform" in this phase (no new iOS features); Share/Receive are hidden on iOS |
| Pack downloads (mirror E2E, onboarding downloads) | Not supported on iOS in this phase (`startDownload` rejects `ERR_CS_UNSUPPORTED`; background `URLSession` comes later); packs are provisioned or imported |
| AI summary, T1 simulation, bench and held-out runs | Need the GGUF model and llama.rn on a device; no model is provisioned on the Simulator (retrieval parity needs no model and runs: see "Follow-up") |
| Blackout battery simulation, energy meter | Android-only tools (`dumpsys battery`, battery current) |
| Airplane mode in the flows | Maestro cannot toggle it on iOS; this build has no code path to the network (downloads unsupported, no P2P) |
| Driven (non-idle) macOS egress, desktop smoke | `tauri-driver` does not support macOS (WKWebView has no WebDriver); the idle egress run is done |

## Pending a real device or Mac

- llama.rn with Metal and the GGUF model on an iPhone; the desktop Metal path with a model (CI has no model).
- GPS, compass and torch on hardware; the "while in use" location prompt.
- `pmtiles://file://` on a real iPhone (the Simulator renders it).
- Keychain behaviour after an unsigned rebuild of the macOS app (the item's ACL names the old binary).
- Signing, notarisation, TestFlight, App Store review (GPL question in "Licences and legal").

## CI runs and timings

Main, after the merge of PR #2 (rebased; all jobs green in both runs):

Iterations on the PR (all on `phase-3b0-apple-ci`): 38152805309 (macOS: dead constant on non-Windows; iOS: Swift circular reference), 38154347355 (Metal link: compiler-rt), 38156090024 (test-host CC path, test fixes; desktop-macos first green), 38158141683 (Swift 26/26; Maestro white screen → Keychain), 38162035127 (secure-storage fix + ad-hoc copy: Maestro 7/7; one flaky title assertion), 38165134459 (all green; ccache wired).

Cost note: the repository is public, so GitHub-hosted macOS minutes are not billed; on a private repository macOS minutes count 10× against the plan. The nightly run starts only the Apple jobs: since the follow-up `ios-build` + `ios-e2e` + `desktop-macos`, ~41 macOS minutes warm.

## Follow-up: iOS CI split and retrieval parity on the Simulator (2026-10-12)

### Job split

- **`ios-build`** (push to main and pull requests, on the iOS path filter): steps 1–5 above (Release
  Simulator build, link checks, bundle scan, Swift unit tests). When `ios-e2e` will run, it also builds the
  ad-hoc Simulator copy and hands both apps to `ios-e2e` as one uncompressed tar artifact (kept 3 days).
- **`ios-e2e`** (nightly on main, `workflow_dispatch`, pull requests labelled `ios-e2e`; `needs: ios-build`):
  no Xcode build. It downloads the apps, checks that the copy has no team identity, provisions the packs
  (cache) and runs `e2e/ios/run-ios-e2e.sh`: the secure-storage failure flow, flows 01–06 and the parity run.
- `workflow_dispatch` input `cold`: the iOS jobs restore and save no cache (cold timing runs).
- Swift tests: `build-for-testing` first, then a fresh Simulator is booted, then `test-without-building`.
  The first boot of a Simulator on the 3-core runner takes 1.5–3 min of CPU and disk. Tried and dropped:
  booting it in parallel with `pnpm install` (install 15 s → 3 min 52 s) or with `xcodebuild` (5 min →
  11 min 34 s, ccache 676/676 both times), and reusing the runner image's device (boot ~100 s, but a long
  settle afterwards and a Maestro driver failure in the next E2E run).
- Maestro: `MAESTRO_DRIVER_STARTUP_TIMEOUT` 300 s, and one retry of a flow only on a driver error ("iOS
  driver not ready in time", `DeviceUnreachableException`; the first attempt's log and JUnit are kept and
  the job prints a warning). Simulator typing can drop characters under load: run 38229617151 typed
  "Wurification" for "Water purification" (0 full-text results, flow 02 failed; the other 8 flows and the
  parity run passed). Flows 02, 03 and 04 now type, submit and check the first outcome inside one Maestro
  `retry` (erase, retype once). A wrong app result still fails both attempts.

### Timings

Old single job (`ios-simulator`): cold 47 min 39 s, warm 34 min 51 s (runs 38167191548, 38170634902).

| Run | Kind | `ios-build` | `ios-e2e` | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [38243154663](https://github.com/Fiouri/skepi/actions/runs/38243154663) | main, dispatch `cold=true` | 25 min 26 s | 28 min 37 s | All jobs green; Maestro 7/7; parity PASS |
| [38229617151](https://github.com/Fiouri/skepi/actions/runs/38229617151) | main, dispatch, warm | 14 min 36 s (incl. ad-hoc copy 1 min 27 s) | 18 min 59 s | Flow 02 failed (typing, above); parity PASS |
| [38237834411](https://github.com/Fiouri/skepi/actions/runs/38237834411) | branch, dispatch, warm (typing retry) | 14 min 22 s | 34 min 05 s (slow runner: every flow ~2×, driver start 4 min) | All jobs green; Maestro 7/7, no retry used; parity PASS |
| [38224310841](https://github.com/Fiouri/skepi/actions/runs/38224310841) | PR #3, label, warm | 14 min 38 s | 17 min 49 s | All jobs green; Maestro 7/7; parity PASS |
| [38227883505](https://github.com/Fiouri/skepi/actions/runs/38227883505) | main push, warm | 14 min 50 s (no ad-hoc copy) | skipped (by design) | All jobs green |
| [38243150124](https://github.com/Fiouri/skepi/actions/runs/38243150124) | main push, warm | 15 min 43 s (Swift test step 7 min 04 s) | skipped (by design) | All jobs green |

| `ios-build` step | Cold | Warm |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CoreKiwix download + verify | 1 min 18 s | cache |
| `pod install` | 1 min 44 s | 42–58 s |
| `xcodebuild` Release (Simulator) | 13 min 30 s (ccache 0/676) | 5 min 05 s – 5 min 20 s (676/676) |
| Swift tests (build-for-testing, boot, 26 tests) | 5 min 49 s | 5 min 47 s – 7 min 04 s, of which the boot and settle ≈ 4–5 min |
| Ad-hoc copy (only when `ios-e2e` runs) | 1 min 09 s | 1 min 03 s – 1 min 27 s |

`ios-e2e`: the Simulator boot takes 105–165 s. Packs come from the cache (~795 MB restore, ~5 s) or are
downloaded and hashed (cold: 4 packs in ~32 s). The flows, including Maestro's driver start, take 12–28 min depending on the runner; the parity flow alone takes ~1 min.

The < 15 min warm target for a path-filtered push is met in 4 of 6 warm `ios-build` runs (14 min 22 s –
14 min 50 s). The two misses are 15 min 43 s and the cold run. What is left above the target is the
Simulator boot inside the Swift test step. A faster runner class (paid) or skipping the Swift tests on PRs
would cut it; both were left out.

### Retrieval parity iOS ↔ eval ↔ S23 ↔ desktop: done

The 108 English questions of the golden set (T2, `contextSize` 2048, the zimDefault packs) run through
`retrieve()` on the Simulator: Bench → "Run retrieval parity", `probeRetrieval`, no model. Every step is
compared with the stored hardening runs of 2026-10-11 (`tools/rag-eval/parity-reference/`: Galaxy S23,
desktop Rust libzim, rag-eval python-libzim; 108/108 identical to each other): keywords, per-archive search
lists, fused hits, article text hashes, ranked chunks, status and chosen sources.
`parity.ts --device … --reference` writes `parity-reference.md` to the job summary and fails on any
difference.

**Result: iOS Simulator (CoreKiwix 14.2.1-2) 108/108 identical to S23, desktop and rag-eval** in every run
above that reached the parity stage: 38208915241, 38224310841, 38229617151, 38237834411, 38243154663.
CoreKiwix links full ICU data and the Android AAR does not. This produced no difference on these
questions (English, the zimDefault packs); the Greek set stays frozen (manual, `--greek`).
